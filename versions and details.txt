## Version 1: Local Storage Implementation

### Overview:
This version of the website relies on local storage for data storage and management. It allows teachers to add courses, add resources to courses, and create tests. Students can enroll in courses, view course resources, and take tests.

### Features:
- Teachers can add courses with descriptions.
- Teachers can add resources (files) to courses.
- Teachers can create tests with different types of questions.
- Students can enroll in courses.
- Students can view resources attached to courses.
- Students can take tests created by teachers.

### Technologies Used:
- HTML, CSS, JavaScript for front-end development.
- Local storage for data persistence.
- Basic JavaScript for handling user interactions.
- Selenium for automated testing.

### Setup and Usage:
1. Clone or download the project repository.
2. Open the project directory in your code editor.
3. Open the HTML files in a web browser to interact with the website.
4. Use the provided JavaScript files to modify or extend functionality.
5. Modify the CSS files to customize the website's appearance.

### Testing with Selenium:
Test Scenarios: Test scripts were created to cover various user interactions and functionalities of the website, including course enrollment, resource viewing, and test taking.
Selenium Setup: Selenium WebDriver was installed and configured in a programming language such as Python.
Test Script Development: Test scripts were written using Selenium WebDriver to automate user interactions on the website.
Execution: The test scripts were executed to validate the functionality of the website, ensuring that courses could be added, resources viewed, and tests taken successfully.
